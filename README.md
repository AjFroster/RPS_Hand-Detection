Thank you for the clarification. Based on this information, here's a revised README for your Rock, Paper, Scissors game with hand detection:
Rock, Paper, Scissors Game with Hand Detection
Purpose

This project is a web-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game that uses real-time hand detection to allow users to play against a computer. The game leverages computer vision techniques to recognize hand gestures corresponding to rock, paper, or scissors.
Setup and Installation

Ensure Python is installed on your system. Then, install the required dependencies:

bash

pip install Flask Flask-SocketIO opencv-python mediapipe

Running the Application

    Navigate to the project directory.
    Run the Flask app:

    bash

    python app.py

    Access the application through a web browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

How to Play

    Once the application is running, position your hand within your webcam's field of view.
    The game will detect your hand gestures, identifying them as either rock, paper, or scissors.
    Play against the computer, which will randomly select its move.
    The application will determine the winner of each round based on the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

Technical Details

    The app.py file is the main Flask application.
    The handcam.py script is responsible for hand detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
    Real-time communication between the client and server is managed using Flask-SocketIO.

Enjoy playing Rock, Paper, Scissors with an interactive hand detection feature!
